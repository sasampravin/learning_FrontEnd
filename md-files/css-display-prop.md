## Display properties in CSS

__Type of HTML elements :__ -

__*Block level*__: which takes the whole width of  the web page.
	Ex : h1- h6, div, p, ol, ul, li, dd, dl, dt, table, header, footer, hr, form, etc.
Inline —--> which will adjust according to their length and these are followed in the same line of the web page row and they remain the same.
	Ex : span, big, small, sub, sup, a, img, strong, abbr, b, br, button, i, input, label, textarea, etc.

CSS display properties :
display : inline  —-> elements in the inline will take the length as they require even though we increase the width of those elements.
display : inline-block —-> here the inline elements will take the length as we mentioned and adjust according to the page.
display : none —--> it will remove the elements and the space occupied by them. 
visibility : hidden —-> it will remove the elements but not the space occupied by them.
